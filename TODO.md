## BUGS:
* [ ] - Translations do not update immediately after language change (requires manual refresh).
* [ ] - Newly created account doesn't appear on the list immediately (requires manual refresh after a few seconds).
## TODO:
* [ ] - Add information for future contributors (e.g., contribution guidelines).
* [ ] - Implement functionality for the Settings page or remove it (currently mocked).
* [ ] - Restrict domain part when creating a new account to domains configured in the mail server (e.g., using a select/autocomplete).
